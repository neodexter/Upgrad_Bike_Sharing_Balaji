## General Information
- BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has seen significant drops in revenue due to the Covid-19 pandemic. To recover post-lockdown, the company plans to create a strategic business plan to boost revenue. They aim to understand the demand for shared bikes after the pandemic ends, so they can better serve customers and gain a competitive edge in the market.

- BoomBikes has contracted a consulting firm to analyze the factors influencing bike demand. Specifically, they want to know:

	•	Which variables are most significant in predicting bike demand.
	•	How well these variables explain the demand.
- Dataset being used is day 'day.csv' and is part of the repo

## Conclusions
- Demand for bike sharing increases with increase in temperature
- Bike rental demand is lesser in wet/rainy/snowy weather
- Demand for bikes increases year on year in general
- Demand for bikes decreases if the windspeed is more


## Technologies Used
